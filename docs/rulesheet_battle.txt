SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE: BATTLE MODE
------------------------------
A new twist where capturing a square is only half the battle — can you keep it?

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
• Paper and pencil (or dry-erase board)
• Draw one big 3×3 grid.  
  Inside each big square, draw another 3×3 tic-tac-toe board.  
  That makes 9 little boards total.

GOAL
----
Win by controlling three big boards in a row (across, down, or diagonal).
But remember — captured boards can be stolen back!

HOW TO PLAY
------------
1. The first player (X) can start anywhere on any little board.
2. The space chosen (1–9) tells the opponent which big board they must play in next.

   Example:
   - X plays in Big Box 1, Little Box 3 → O must play in Big Box 3.
   - O plays in Big Box 3, Little Box 6 → X must play in Big Box 6.

3. If the next big board is **full**, you can choose **any open** big board.

4. Each big board is its own small tic-tac-toe game:
   - Win three in a row to **capture** that big board.
   - If a board fills with no winner, it is **dead** (no one owns it).

5. **Battle Rule:**  
   - Captured boards are *not safe!*  
   - Your opponent can **recapture** a big board by winning a new three-in-a-row
     on that same board, even if you already owned it.
   - Each capture overwrites the previous one — ownership changes instantly.

6. You can always play in any big board that is **not full**, even if it is currently captured.

WINNING THE WHOLE GAME
-----------------------
• The first player to control **three big boards in a row** wins!  
• If every big board is full and no one has three in a row, it’s a draw.

TIPS
----
• Capturing fast isn’t enough — you have to defend what you’ve taken.  
• Watch for boards where the opponent can flip ownership back in one turn.  
• Keeping multiple partial wins alive across different boards makes it harder for them to counterattack.  
• Every move affects both local and global strategy — think ahead!

GAME LOGIC CHECK
----------------
✓ Players alternate turns; the forced-board rule still applies.  
✓ Recapturing does not reset the small board; marks remain until it fills.  
✓ Each big board can change ownership many times until it is full.  
✓ Game always ends when all big boards are full or a player holds three in a row.  
✓ No logical deadlocks — only added layers of competition.  

BATTLE MODE SUMMARY
-------------------
This version plays faster, meaner, and more tactical.  
You must balance **attack**, **defense**, and **timing** — every square you win can be taken right back!
