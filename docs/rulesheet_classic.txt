SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE
-----------------
A bigger, trickier version of normal tic-tac-toe!

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
• Paper and pencil (or dry-erase board)
• Draw one big 3×3 grid.  
  Inside each big square, draw another 3×3 tic-tac-toe board.  
  That makes 9 little boards total.

HOW TO PLAY
------------
1. The first player (X) can start anywhere on any little board.
2. The spot you pick (1–9) tells your opponent which big board they must play in next.

   Example:
   - You play in Big Box 1, Little Box 3 → opponent must play on Big Box 3.
   - They play in Big Box 3, Little Box 6 → you must play on Big Box 6.

3. If the next big board is **full**, you can choose any other big board to play in.
4. If the next big board has **open spaces**, you MUST play there — even if someone already won or tied that little game.

WINNING LITTLE BOARDS
---------------------
• Each big board is its own tiny tic-tac-toe game.  
• Win three in a row on that little board to **capture** it for your team.  
• Drawn (tied) little boards are **dead** — no one owns them.  
• Even if a board is captured or dead, you can still play there if the rules send you there.

WINNING THE WHOLE GAME
-----------------------
• The first player to capture **three big boards in a row** (across, down, or diagonal) wins!  
• If every big board is full and no one has three in a row, it’s a draw.

TIPS
----
• Think ahead! The square you choose now decides where your opponent must go next.
• Sometimes forcing them into a captured or full board can block their plans.
• Keep the game moving — it always ends after 81 turns or less.

Have fun, Super Players!
