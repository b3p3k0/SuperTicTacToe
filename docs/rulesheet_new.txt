SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE (NEW RULES)
-----------------------------
A big, fun version of tic-tac-toe played across nine smaller boards — now with three game styles you can choose from.

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
• Paper and pencil (or dry-erase board)
• Draw one big 3×3 grid.  
  Inside each big square, draw another 3×3 tic-tac-toe board.  
  That makes 9 little boards total.

GOAL
----
Win by capturing three big boards in a row — across, down, or diagonal.

HOW TO PLAY
------------
1. The first player (X) can start anywhere on any little board.
2. The space they pick (1–9) decides which big board the other player must play in next.

   Example:
   - X plays in Big Box 1, Little Box 3 → O must play in Big Box 3.
   - O plays in Big Box 3, Little Box 6 → X must play in Big Box 6.

3. If the next big board is **full**, the next player may choose **any open** big board.

4. Each big board is its own tiny game:
   - Win three in a row on a little board to **capture** that big board.
   - A tied (drawn) little board is **dead** — no one owns it.

5. When a big board is captured or dead, it becomes **closed** — players can no longer play moves there.

6. If a move would send a player to a **closed** board, they may instead choose **any open** big board.

THREE WAYS TO PLAY
------------------
• **Modern Mode (default)**  
  - Captured and dead big boards are closed and cannot be played on.  
  - If a move points to a closed board, the next player can choose any open board.  
  - Fast and easy to learn.

• **Classic Mode (strategic)**  
  - Captured and dead big boards stay playable if there are still open spaces.  
  - You can be forced to move into already-won or dead boards, adding deeper strategy.

• **Battle Mode (recapture)**  
  - Captured boards stay playable and can be stolen back until that mini-board fills.  
  - Forces both players to juggle offense and defense every turn.  
  - See the dedicated Battle rulesheet for the full rundown.

HOW TO WIN
----------
• First player to capture three big boards in a row wins.  
• If every big board is full, captured, or dead and no one has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

TIPS
----
• Plan ahead! The small square you pick tells your opponent where to go next.
• In Classic Mode, forcing them into a dead or captured board can be a clever trap.
• In Modern Mode, pick your next move wisely since you have more freedom.
• Every game ends in 81 moves or fewer.

Have fun and may the best player rule the Super Board!
